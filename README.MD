# San Francisco Police Crime Data
This set of functions is used to take the trian data from the 
SF Crime Kaggle Competition and turn it into a neat data frame
that contains a summary of all the crimes that occured broken
down by variables specified in SF_sort function. This training
data is converted into a probability table and the table can
then be used with the test data to predict what crime has occurred based on data, time, Polic District, and day of the Week.
